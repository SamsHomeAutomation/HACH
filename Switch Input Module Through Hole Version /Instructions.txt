Switch Input Module Through Hole Version

This module is designed to connect to a Sonoff 4ch Pro or other control module and is used to attach standard toggle light switches, retractive light switches, push buttons, and dry contacts volt-free contacts.

Populate PCB with the following components:

3.5mm pitch screw terminals
10k pull-up resistors
100nf debounce capacitors
MCP23017 I2C port expander
3 pole DIP switch
4k7 I2C bus resistors
470R link port bus resistors
I2C bus extender IC
RJ45 connectors
Mount the PCB on 25mm pitch DIN rail mounts or UM72 PCB DIN rail carrier.

Use an RJ45 patch lead to connect the module to the Sonoff 4ch Pro or other control module.

Attach light switches to pairs of screw terminals.

Program your controller with ESPHome and edit YAML to include MCP23017 binary inputs. For more information, please refer to esphome.io.
